No Warranties
-------------

The Application is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law, Metastream, on its own behalf and on behalf of
its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties
of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-

of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing,
Metastream provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of
any kind that the Application will meet your requirements, achieve any
intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,
systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or

will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither Metastream nor any Metastream's

trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied
warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a
consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply
to you.

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of
Metastream and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and
your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount
actually paid by you for the Application.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
Metastream or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect,
or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages
for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business
interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in
any way related to the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party
software and/or third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise
in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Metastream or any
supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the
remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you.

Severability
------------

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid,
such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of
such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the
remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

Waiver
------

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's

subsequent breach.
