## Legacy desktop app

Metastream used to be an Electron desktop application until development was stopped due to [roadblocks in acquiring a Widevine license](https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/google-widevine-blocked-my-browser/). The latest version can be found on the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream/releases/tag/v0.2.7) page. Please note that **the legacy app is insecure and not recommended.**
